I need someone to tell me what's best movie novel. I keep this but never read it again. It shows I like to read books to improve myself. After I talk something, they shock I read so less books. So don't keep this bookmark or an awesome list like "sindresorhus/awesome: 😎 Awesome lists about all kinds of interesting topics". I like to keep awesome list but never read them again.
